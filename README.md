# Introduction 

With the rise of malicious software, code obfuscation has become an essential tool for protecting software from reverse engineering. Code obfuscation is the process of making software code difficult to understand, analyze, and modify by humans. Obfuscation can be used to protect proprietary code and make it difficult for adversaries to understand, analyze, and modify. Code obfuscation can also be used to protect against malicious actors such as hackers, virus writers, and malicious software developers.

The most common form of code obfuscation is virtualization, which involves the transformation of code into a virtual program that is no longer recognizable as its original source code. Virtualization allows the code to be executed without the need for a human-readable form.

Unfortunately, virtualization makes it difficult for security analysts to understand the behavior of virtualized programs. The internal mechanism of commercial obfuscators is a black box, making it a daunting challenge for the analyst to understand the behavior of virtualized programs. To figure out the code virtualization mechanism and design deobfuscation techniques, the analyst has to perform reverse-engineering on large-scale highly obfuscated programs.

# Point
Malware authors are increasingly turning to commercial obfuscators to make their code more difficult to reverse engineer. Such obfuscators are designed to make code more difficult to read, analyze, and comprehend. This makes it difficult for security researchers to understand the functionality of the malicious code and determine its purpose.

Malware authors typically use these obfuscators to hide the functionality of the malicious code, making it difficult to detect or identify. Additionally, some malware may use obfuscators to evade detection by antivirus software.

The most popular obfuscators used by malware authors include Eazfuscator.NET, .Net Reactor, VMProtect, Agile, and ConfuserEX. These obfuscators are designed to make code more difficult to understand by introducing a variety of techniques, including string encryption, control flow obfuscation, and code virtualization.

However, some of these obfuscators are not foolproof and can be defeated by skilled security researchers. Additionally, some of these obfuscators can be detected by using static and dynamic analysis. As a result, it is important for security researchers to remain vigilant and employ appropriate countermeasures to detect and identify malware abusing commercial obfuscators.
